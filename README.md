Being that most of the Dev team is remote, I wanted to build an app that would allow for showing if a user is available and details for contact. Being spread all about the world time zones, the ability to see who is available to contact and methods of contacting would be a great tool to have. The display that I have for this would be for an admin, so the ability to add users would be displayed on the right side.

With remote being a large part of dev teams, building app would need unique time zones for each user, an (available/unavailable) toggle, and contact info which would update depending on state. Set the profile as Admin allowing for adding users with the information.
